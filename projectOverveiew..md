#### Project Overview of the Radio Cards.

### What are radio cards?
- Well radio cards are just elements normally found in a form but now in many other places that implement a functionality of the user picking only one items out of many in a list of items.This functionality can be used in many scenarios like a list of packages on a service website and you only have to pick one of them. Or a list of technologies that you are going to use e.g from REACT, Vue and Angular and you have to pick one.

#### Functionality of the Project (using HTML and CSS)
- Users must be able to see the list of items in a group such that it might be easy to identify that the user must pick from one item.
- Using radio functionality is optional (input type="radio") but it must look like a radio card
- The information to be used can be gotten from any source for example it might be a service company giving options of packages or it might be a developer having to choose from a list of frameworks or anything else that brings out the point.
- The user must be able to know that he/she has selected a certain items out of the list of items i.e The color of the selected item might change together with the radio of the item.
- The user can ony select one items out of all the items.
- The items should be clearly visible to the user.

#### Tech stack
- For design of the project figma can be used or anything with similar functionality.
- HTML must be used for the markup of the project
- CSS must also be used for the styling of the project. Any Framework is acceptable like Bootstrap or Tailwind (more recommended).
