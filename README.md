## A Radio Cards project with JavaScript

#### Overivew
This is project makes use of the radio button functionality in HTML and makes a custom webpage of items you can choose from. Of the three items you should choose one of them.

#### Tech Stack
On this project I used Figma for designing the whole project on small and large screens. HTML for the markup and Tailwind for styling it up to the end.


### What I learned
I learned that when you just jump into a project it's more likely that you will get stuck at some point and that's because you may not have thought of what the user may need as a feature or something else hence it is very good that you have a sort of project overview where you list what the user needs how it can be easily met according to the technologies you are going to use then the next step will be making a prototype of how it will look and that's by designing it from scratch making sure you meet all the requirements of the user you are building for.
